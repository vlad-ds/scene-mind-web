  <h1>Data Security & Confidentiality</h1>

  <section style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    <h2>Your Intellectual Property is Safe With Us</h2>
    
    <p>We understand that your movie and TV scripts are highly confidential and represent valuable intellectual property. Protecting this data is a top priority in all our services, from the moment you share it with us, through processing, and during storage. We are committed to transparency and robust security practices.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 0;">Key Commitment: Your script data submitted through our services is never used to train the underlying AI models of our providers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>How We Handle Your Data</h3>
    <p>When you use our services, whether providing scripts for analysis or using our platform features, here's how we ensure security and confidentiality at every stage:</p>

    <p><strong>Secure File Reception:</strong> When you need to send us scripts, we utilize secure file transfer methods (like dedicated secure upload links) designed to protect your data in transit, ensuring only authorized personnel receive it.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Secure Processing & Storage:</strong> Your data resides and is processed in one of two secure environments, under our direct control:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Local Encrypted Storage:</strong> Scripts and related data may be processed and stored locally utilizing built-in full-disk encryption. Access is strictly controlled.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Google Cloud Platform:</strong> Alternatively, processing and storage may occur within our secure Google Cloud Platform environment. We implement and manage robust security configurations within Google Cloud to protect your data, leveraging its security features while ensuring appropriate access controls and data handling protocols are followed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Access Control:</strong> Strict access controls, both locally and on cloud storage, ensure only necessary personnel can access your data solely for the purpose of providing the requested service or for secure archival.</p>

    <p><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> Data transmitted between your system, our service, the AI APIs, and secure cloud storage uses encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).</p>

    <p><strong>Data Minimization & Retention:</strong> We only process and store the data necessary for the service. We retain your data only as long as needed and as agreed upon, after which it is securely deleted upon request or after a defined period.</p>
    
    <h3>AI API Provider Policies</h3>
    <p>We leverage leading AI API platforms designed for business use. Their policies regarding data usage during processing are crucial to our commitment:</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> We use OpenAI's API platform for business services. Based on OpenAI's official documentation, your data processed through the OpenAI API will not be used to train OpenAI's models unless we explicitly choose to opt-in to data sharing with OpenAI. By default, data sharing for model training is disabled for API users.<br>

    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Anthropic API:</strong> We use the Anthropic API for certain services. According to Anthropic's privacy policy, your data processed through the Anthropic API will not be used to train Anthropic's models except in very specific circumstances (such as for Trust & Safety reviews, explicit reporting, or explicit opt-in for training). Anthropic's policy explicitly states: "We will not use your Inputs or Outputs to train our models" outside of these exceptions.<br>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">How We Handle Your Data</h3>
          <p class="mb-3">When you use our services, whether providing scripts for analysis or using our platform features, here's how we ensure security and confidentiality at every stage:</p>

          <p class="font-medium text-white mb-2">Secure File Reception:</p>
          <p class="mb-4">When you need to send us scripts, we utilize secure file transfer methods (like dedicated secure upload links) designed to protect your data in transit, ensuring only authorized personnel receive it.</p>

          <p class="font-medium text-white mb-2">Secure Processing & Storage:</p>
          <p class="mb-2">Your data resides and is processed in one of two secure environments, under our direct control:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><span class="font-medium text-white">Local Encrypted Storage:</span> Scripts and related data may be processed and stored locally utilizing built-in full-disk encryption. Access is strictly controlled.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium text-white">Google Cloud Platform:</span> Alternatively, processing and storage may occur within our secure Google Cloud Platform environment. We implement and manage robust security configurations within Google Cloud to protect your data, leveraging its security features while ensuring appropriate access controls and data handling protocols are followed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="font-medium text-white mb-2">Access Control:</p>
          <p class="mb-4">Strict access controls, both locally and on cloud storage, ensure only necessary personnel can access your data solely for the purpose of providing the requested service or for secure archival.</p>

          <p class="font-medium text-white mb-2">Secure Transmission:</p>
          <p class="mb-4">Data transmitted between your system, our service, the AI APIs, and secure cloud storage uses encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).</p>

          <p class="font-medium text-white mb-2">Data Minimization & Retention:</p>
          <p>We only process and store the data necessary for the service. We retain your data only as long as needed and as agreed upon, after which it is securely deleted upon request or after a defined period.</p>
